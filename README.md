# Flutter Timeline

Flutter Timeline is a package which shows a list posts by a user. This package also has additional features like liking a post and leaving comments. Default this package adds support for a Firebase back-end. You can add your custom back-end (like a Websocket-API) by extending the `CommunityChatInterface` interface from the `flutter_community_chat_interface` package.

## Setup
To use this package, add flutter_timeline as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file:

```
  flutter_timeline
    git: 
        url: https://github.com/Iconica-Development/flutter_timeline.git
        path: packages/flutter_timeline
```

If you are going to use Firebase as the back-end of the Timeline, you should also add the following package as a dependency to your pubspec.yaml file:

```
  flutter_timeline_firebase:
    git: 
        url: https://github.com/Iconica-Development/flutter_timeline.git
        path: packages/flutter_timeline_firebase
```

Add the following code in your `main` function, before the runApp().
```
  initializeDateFormatting();
```

## How to use
To use the module within your Flutter-application with predefined `Go_router` routes you should add the following:

Add go_router as dependency to your project.
Add the following configuration to your flutter_application:

```
List<GoRoute> getTimelineStoryRoutes() => getTimelineStoryRoutes(
      TimelineUserStoryConfiguration(
        service: FirebaseTimelineService(),
        userService: FirebaseUserService(),
        userId: currentUserId,
        optionsBuilder: (context) => FirebaseOptions(),
      ),
    );
```

Add the `getTimelineStoryRoutes()` to your go_router routes like so:

```
final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
  routes: <RouteBase>[
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
        return const MyHomePage(
          title: "home",
        );
      },
    ),
    ...getTimelineStoryRoutes(timelineUserStoryConfiguration)
  ],
);
```

The user story can also be used without go router:
Add the following code somewhere in your widget tree:

````
timeLineNavigatorUserStory(TimelineUserStoryConfiguration, context),
````


Or create your own routing using the Screens:
To add the `TimelineScreen` add the following code:

````
TimelineScreen(
  userId:  currentUserId,
  service: timelineService,
  options: timelineOptions,
),
````

`TimelineScreen` is supplied with a standard `TimelinePostScreen` which opens the detail page of the selected post. Needed parameter like `TimelineService` and `TimelineOptions` will be the same as the ones supplied to the `TimelineScreen`.

The standard `TimelinePostScreen` can be overridden by defining `onPostTap` as shown below.

```
TimelineScreen(
  userId:  currentUserId,
  service: timelineService,
  options: timelineOptions,
  onPostTap: (tappedPost) {
    await Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => Scaffold(
          body: TimelinePostScreen(
            userId:  currentUserId,
            service: timelineService,
            options: timelineOptions,
            post: post,
            onPostDelete: () {
             service.deletePost(post);
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

A standard post creation is provided named: `TimelinePostCreationScreen`. Routing to this has to be done manually.

```
TimelinePostCreationScreen(
  postCategory: selectedCategory,
  userId: currentUserId,
  service: timelineService,
  options: timelineOptions,
  onPostCreated: (post) {
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  },
),
```

The `TimelineOptions` has its own parameters, as specified below:
